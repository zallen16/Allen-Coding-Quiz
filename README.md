# Allen-Coding-Quiz

This week's assignment consisted of no starter code and we were tasked with creating a quiz application with a timer starting from zero. Extensive work was done with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in order to create an interactive quiz with topical coding-related questions that fill up the screen in an appealing and welcoming way. 

Assistance with assignment was given by TAs in program as well as tutors Bobbi Tarkany and Jose Lopez.
